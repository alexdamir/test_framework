Great question! With Poetry, you don't need to manually create and manage virtual environments - Poetry handles this automatically. However, let me explain the full workflow and when virtual environments come into play:

## Poetry's Automatic Virtual Environment Management

**Poetry automatically creates and manages virtual environments for you:**

```bash
# When you run this, Poetry automatically:
# 1. Creates a virtual environment if it doesn't exist
# 2. Installs dependencies into that virtual environment
poetry install
```

## Complete Setup Workflow

Here's the proper order of operations:

### 1. Initial Project Setup
```bash
# Create project directory
mkdir test_framework
cd test_framework

# Initialize Poetry project (creates pyproject.toml)
poetry init

# OR if you already have the pyproject.toml file:
# Just run poetry install directly
```

### 2. Poetry Automatically Handles Virtual Environment
```bash
# This command automatically:
# - Creates a virtual environment (.venv folder or in Poetry's cache)
# - Installs all dependencies listed in pyproject.toml
# - Links the project to the virtual environment
poetry install
```

### 3. Install Playwright Browsers
```bash
# Run this AFTER poetry install
poetry run playwright install
```

## If You Want Manual Control Over Virtual Environment

If you prefer to manage the virtual environment location manually:

```bash
# Tell Poetry to create .venv in project directory
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true

# Then install (this creates .venv folder in your project)
poetry install
```

## Running Commands

After `poetry install`, you have two ways to run commands:

```bash
# Option 1: Use poetry run (recommended)
poetry run behave
poetry run playwright install
poetry run python -m pytest

# Option 2: Activate the shell and run directly
poetry shell
behave
playwright install
python -m pytest
```

## Complete Step-by-Step Setup

```bash
# 1. Create and navigate to project directory
mkdir test_framework
cd test_framework

# 2. Create all the files from the framework structure
# (copy the pyproject.toml and other files)

# 3. Install dependencies (creates virtual environment automatically)
poetry install

# 4. Install Playwright browsers
poetry run playwright install

# 5. Run tests
poetry run behave
```

## Virtual Environment Location

Poetry stores virtual environments in different locations depending on your configuration:

```bash
# Check where Poetry stores virtual environments
poetry config virtualenvs.path

# See the virtual environment for current project
poetry env info

# Force Poetry to create .venv in project directory
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
```

## Summary

**You don't need to manually create virtual environments with Poetry** - it's all handled automatically when you run `poetry install`. The virtual environment is created behind the scenes, and you use `poetry run <command>` to execute commands within that environment.

The typical workflow is simply:
1. Create project files
2. `poetry install` (virtual environment created automatically)
3. `poetry run playwright install`
4. `poetry run behave`

This is one of the main benefits of Poetry - it eliminates the manual virtual environment management that you'd have with pip + virtualenv!
